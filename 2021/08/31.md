##### BIGINT(20) && INT(20)

See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/numeric-types.html

- `INT` is a four-byte signed integer.
- `BIGINT` is an eight-byte signed integer.

They each accept no more and no fewer values than can be stored in their respective number of bytes. That means 232 values in an `INT` and 264 values in a `BIGINT`.

The 20 in `INT(20)` and `BIGINT(20)` means almost nothing. It's a hint for display width. It has nothing to do with storage, nor the range of values that column will accept.

Practically, it affects only the `ZEROFILL` option:

```sql
CREATE TABLE foo ( bar INT(20) ZEROFILL );
INSERT INTO foo (bar) VALUES (1234);
SELECT bar from foo;

+----------------------+
| bar                  |
+----------------------+
| 00000000000000001234 |
+----------------------+
```

It's a common source of confusion for MySQL users to see `INT(20)` and assume it's a size limit, something analogous to `CHAR(20)`. This is not the case.
